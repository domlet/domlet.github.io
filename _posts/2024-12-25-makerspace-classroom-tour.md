### Dark mode

[Enabling Dark Mode](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/unlock-dark-mode-for-hs-computer-scien/6868466/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=project&utm_term=teacher_8637964&rf=page-dc-2024-12-project-teacher_8637964&challengeid=22010160) for my classroom was one of my first priorities as a teacher. Why? Like many programmers, I learned to program in the dark. Dark Mode reduces distractions and deepens focus for people with visual sensitivities or attention issues. It can also reduce eye strain for people staring at screens for long periods of time. Most students love it. Students understand that dark mode may be enabled once ALL STUDENTS are logged into Google Classroom or have an assignment open – so they encourage each other to get started promptly.

### Robotics area

In the robotics area, students use a great number of tools and materials that must be kept organized and accessible. Mechanical and software engineers must communicate with each other.

### Classroom Garden (AgTech)

["Programmable Succulent Garden w/Moisture Sensors"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1dZvnDK8diLR5ri1aDfE1h_smqfcFox2VEQXFZTv0k/edit?tab=t.0) is a physical computing project that literally brings computer science "to life" by having students (in pairs) program individual soil sensors to detect and log soil moisture levels for individual plants – and then program an alert or action to occur when moisture reaches a specified threshold. Students will learn how the Internet of Things (IoT) enables a programmable home or workplace, with applications in landscaping, agricultural technology, robotics, or Smart Home design.

### Classroom Kitchenette

The [Micro-Kitchen for Engineering Students](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/micro-kitchen-enablement-for-engineering/8451330/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=project&utm_term=teacher_8637964&rf=page-dc-2024-12-project-teacher_8637964&challengeid=22010160) project (Fall 2024) enabled a classroom kitchenette like those students have seen at tech offices like Google or The Hidden Genius Project. The kitchenette fosters students' self-sufficiency around cleanup and cooking, reduces teacher labor for messy or food-related lesson plans, and offers a "side-quest" opportunity for high-achieving students with excess creative energy, and validates students with career aspirations or technical interests related to cooking, food systems, or AgTech.

### Programming is Social

You may have heard of [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)...but what do you call it when three or more teammates code something together at a single computer? This practice (which happens often at hackathons) **can be chaotic, producing mayhem** in software patterns and confusion in participant understanding.

But with teens in particular, when learning is social it can also energize participants, deepening emotional investment, and driving persistence – so **what participants do grasp can be more meaningful and memorable** as the result of the brain's [focus on social connection and belonging](https://flic.kr/p/2qCDnRA) (Siegel, Daniel J.).

In computer science classrooms, we often design spaces and activities that prioritize the development of **deep focus and organized, methodical thinking**. Those practices are crucial for learning how to program computers. But, if we want to offer diverse students the opportunity to love engineering and innovation, we must also create **spaces that stimulate creativity, tolerate mayhem, and facilitate teamwork**. In my classroom, that means:

- Larger screens/displays (for more eyeballs)
- Modular furniture (for more flexibile seating)
- Standing spaces (for more movement between groups)

### Dark Mode Reduces Anxiety

Like many programmers, I learned to program in the dark. [Dark Mode](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/unlock-dark-mode-for-hs-computer-scien/6868466/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=project&utm_term=teacher_8637964&rf=page-dc-2024-12-project-teacher_8637964&challengeid=22010160) can reduce distractions and deepen focus for people with visual sensitivities or attention issues. It can also reduce eye strain.

Students understand that dark mode can be enabled once ALL STUDENTS are logged into Google Classroom or have an assignment open – so they encourage each other to get started promptly.

### Mechatronics: Mechanical × Electronics

In the robotics area, students use a great number of tools and materials that must be kept organized and accessible. Mechanical and software engineers must communicate with each other.

### Programmable IoT Garden

["Programmable Succulent Garden w/Moisture Sensors"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1dZvnDK8diLR5ri1aDfE1h_smqfcFox2VEQXFZTv0k/edit?tab=t.0) is a physical computing project that literally brings computer science "to life" by having students (in pairs) program individual soil sensors to detect and log soil moisture levels for individual plants – and then program an alert or action to occur when moisture reaches a specified threshold.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322817361" title="CCPA Hackerspace Garden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54230910376_b4b09b8040.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CCPA Hackerspace Garden"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Students will learn how the Internet of Things (IoT) enables a programmable home or workplace, with applications in landscaping, agricultural technology, robotics, or Smart Home design.

### Classroom Kitchenette

Our [classroom kitchenette](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/micro-kitchen-enablement-for-engineering/8451330/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=project&utm_term=teacher_8637964&rf=page-dc-2024-12-project-teacher_8637964&challengeid=22010160) is meant to emulate those break areas.
Computer science students at CCPA have seen [micro-kitchens](https://interiorarchitects.com/seven-corporate-and-cool-micro-kitchens/) during field trips to tech offices like Google or The Hidden Genius Project.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322798931" title="Makerspace Kitchen"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54229075300_b5fe291143.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Makerspace Kitchen"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In addition, the kitchen fosters students' self-sufficiency around cleanup and cooking, reduces teacher labor for lesson plans involving food or liquid, and validates students with aspirations or interests related to cooking, food systems, or agricultural technology like hydroponics.

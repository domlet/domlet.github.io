### Programming is Social

You may have heard of [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)...but what do you call it when three or more teammates code something together at a single computer? This practice (which happens often at hackathons) **can be chaotic, producing mayhem** in software patterns and confusion in participant understanding.

But with teens in particular, when learning is social it can also energize participants, deepening emotional investment, and driving persistence – so **what participants do grasp can be more meaningful and memorable** as the result of the brain's [focus on social connection and belonging](https://flic.kr/p/2qCDnRA) (Siegel, Daniel J.).

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322859102" title="CCPA Social Computing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54236335120_69f82cd7f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CCPA Social Computing"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In computer science classrooms, we often design spaces and activities that prioritize the development of **deep focus and organized, methodical thinking**. Those practices are crucial for learning how to program computers. But, if we want to offer diverse students the opportunity to love engineering and innovation, we must also create **spaces that stimulate creativity, tolerate mayhem, and facilitate teamwork**. In my classroom, that means:

- Larger screens/displays (for more eyeballs)
- Modular furniture (for more flexibile seating)
- Standing spaces (for more movement between groups)

### Fab Lab (3D Printers)

Our [green screen wall](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/54236149861/in/album-72177720322882484) was less useful than expected, so this corner features two Prusa MK4 3D printers – a gift from Mark Rober at [Crunch Labs](https://www.crunchlabs.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnyKDnYKV7iJOQ3-LBnI3liLbcYjyO0B_dbOTTyIGMSddNKUoB).

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322882484" title="CCPA Fabrication Laboratory &quot;Fab Lab&quot;"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54236382638_7a49847ccc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CCPA Fabrication Laboratory &quot;Fab Lab&quot;"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Students learn about file formats and intellectual property rights for 3D models, types of plastic filament, print settings (ie, skirt, brim, nozzle and bed temperature, fill patterns) and troubleshooting. Students follow
each-one-teach-one practices to learn from one another, and use the printers mainly during Robotics and Hack Club time.

### Dark Mode Deepens Focus

Like many programmers, I learned to program in the dark, during the still, uninterrupted hours of the night. In our computer science classroom, [Dark Mode](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/unlock-dark-mode-for-hs-computer-scien/6868466/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=project&utm_term=teacher_8637964&rf=page-dc-2024-12-project-teacher_8637964&challengeid=22010160) is designed to offer a similar setting, with reduced distractions for those with visual sensitivities or attention issues. [Dark mode isn't perfect](https://www.fastcompany.com/90421232/dark-mode-is-everywhere-but-is-it-really-better), but many students say they prefer it because "It doesn't feel like a classroom."

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322816217" title="Makerspace Kitchen"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54231262700_3ccb39c2a2.jpg" width="500"  alt="Makerspace Kitchen"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Beneficially for me as an instructor, students understand that dark mode can be enabled **when all students are logged into Google Classroom** or have an assignment open – so they encourage each other to get started promptly. Dark mode also makes it easier for me to focus my eyes on student laptop screens as I circulate around the classroom to check in on students.

### Mechatronics: Mechanical × Electronics

At CCPA, the High School Robotics Team competes in the [FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) in the fall, and the [Pioneers in Engineering (PiE)](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/) competition at UC Berkeley in the Spring. In the Robotics workspace, students use a great number of [tools and materials](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-45-3529/) that must be kept organized and accessible. Only power tools and sharp tools are kept in the teacher's office or desk drawers. Students [pack their own supplies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LVZiLo4UDEgqsqjm0FnSoMNz828F7kkTg-nQiuiSlU4/edit?gid=1899335204#gid=1899335204) before off-campus scrimmages, tournaments, or build days.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322836769" title="CCPA Robotics Lab"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/31337/54231307690_28f8e64dbd.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CCPA Robotics Lab"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Mechanical engineers and software engineers must also coordinate and communicate with each other as they build, so the workspace is designed with a [hardware side](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/54231134918/in/album-72177720322836769) (adjacent to the tools cabinet), and a [software side](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/54229995877/in/album-72177720322836769), where programmers can see and speak to mechanical engineers right over the top edge of the displays at the programmig station. We rarely assemble the [game field](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/54231307690/in/album-72177720322836769) because our furniture is not sufficiently modular to get out of the way.

### Programmable IoT Garden

["Programmable Succulent Garden w/Moisture Sensors"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1dZvnDK8diLR5ri1aDfE1h_smqfcFox2VEQXFZTv0k/edit?tab=t.0) is a physical computing project that literally brings computer science "to life" by having students (in pairs) program individual soil sensors to detect and log soil moisture levels for individual plants – and then program an alert or action to occur when moisture reaches a specified threshold.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322817361" title="CCPA Hackerspace Garden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54230910376_b4b09b8040.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CCPA Hackerspace Garden"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Students will learn how the Internet of Things (IoT) enables a programmable home or workplace, with applications in landscaping, agricultural technology, robotics, or Smart Home design.

### Classroom Kitchenette

Computer science students at CCPA have seen [micro-kitchens](https://interiorarchitects.com/seven-corporate-and-cool-micro-kitchens/) during field trips to tech offices like Google or The Hidden Genius Project. Our [classroom kitchenette](https://www.donorschoose.org/project/micro-kitchen-enablement-for-engineering/8451330/?utm_source=dc&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=project&utm_term=teacher_8637964&rf=page-dc-2024-12-project-teacher_8637964&challengeid=22010160) is meant to emulate those break areas.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dombrassey/albums/72177720322798931" title="Makerspace Kitchen"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54229075300_b5fe291143.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Makerspace Kitchen"/></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In addition, the kitchen fosters students' self-sufficiency around cleanup and cooking, reduces teacher labor for lesson plans involving food or liquid, and validates students with aspirations or interests related to cooking, food systems, or agricultural technology like hydroponics.

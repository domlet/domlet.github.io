## About Prop 13

For the last ~50 years, California's [Proposition&nbsp;13](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/7/20/mapping-the-effects-of-californias-prop-13) has allowed California residents (and businesses) with inherited homes (and privately owned commercial properties) to contribute fewer tax dollars to the state. As a result, education funding in California is significantly privatizated: Wealthier, property-owning Californians have more money to fund **their own** neighborhood public schools (or private schools), but schools **without access** to private funds simply have less money for facilities, field trips, teacher salaries, etc. Businesses paying fewer state taxes can easily choose to keep their money, and not support California schools at all.

The disparity that California students experience as a result of this tax structure is known as _education&nbsp;inequality_. This is why [DonorsChoose is so vital](https://www.donorschoose.org/mxb) for California students and teachers in low-income areas.

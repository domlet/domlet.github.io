## What is it?

- See the [live dashboard here](https://domlet.github.io/dashboard).

## Inspiration

Although our school publishes important dates on a public Google Calendar, **high school students do not typically use Google Calendar**. Instead, they ask me for information like I am Siri. ðŸ’€ I created this dashboard to foster student independence and reduce my own cognitive load. ðŸ˜Œ

## What it does

This [Student Dashboard (Visual Countdown)](https://domlet.github.io/dashboard) is the startup webpage for computers in my classroom. It features the information I think students need most:

1. **The current date**, and day of the week.
1. **A visualization of all the days** of the school year, separated into terms.
1. **Student holidays**, such as teacher inservice days.
1. **Student activities**, such as Picture Day or basketball games.
1. **Important dates**, such as "Rosh Hashanah" or "Last Day of School".
1. **Opportunities**, such as free days at local museums.

## Why it's awesome

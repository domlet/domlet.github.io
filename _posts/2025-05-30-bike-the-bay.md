## What did we do?

![Learning to ride](/assets/img/bike-the-bay-2025/learning-to-ride.gif)
_How it started._

**Bike The Bay was a new Postsession\* experience launched in 2025.** On this adventure, we rented Sport/Hybrid bicycles for a week, and took 22 high school students on [five day trips](https://domlet.github.io/postsession25) to SF Bay Area destinations accessible via BART trains. Students learned about bicycle mechanics, physical fitness, SF Bay Area geography and ecosystems, and how to navigate public spaces and public transit safely and securely with bikes. For full participation, they earned credits to fulfill their Physical Education (PE) requirements for graduation.

## Where did we go?

The five day trips are summarized and [mapped](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=15wuHhGM3TzHTvvgeZnBx-WslYk--ad4&usp=sharing) below. I used the 'Google My Maps' document to generate line geometries for the [mobile app](https://domlet.github.io/postsession25). The [daily itineraries speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNw0e583X1cRLA4AZ16hERlCQ80CRZxfdx6vnaCN4kbLwWOxMPM4ZCv8f8xMjNDImd-IcPwE5bEGCN/pubhtml?gid=624153727&single=true) contains links to the **actual routes**, some of which were shortened to add more time for rest and walking exploration.

### Full budget

**Note on Bike Parking:** On the day of our first trip, an [electrical fire broke out at the San Leandro Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC4jDn89nCE) ‚Äì forcing our group to cross the bay using a combination of AC Transit and BART from 12th Street Station. Because we could not transport our bikes home to Coliseum Station, we locked all our bikes in the BikeLink group parking garage at Embarcadero Station. This was amazing! I've adjusted the budget (below) to include a $20 BikeLink card for each student next year. Students can alternatively use the BikeLink mobile app, which charges only $5 for a one-time verification fee.

## What worked well

- Free water bottles and day packs: 4imprint
- Rented 22 bikes from Sports Basement: $75 ea for up to 9 days
- BikeLink overnight storage

- downhill route from NBRK to WOAK
- printed agendas in pockets
- 'text mxb' on whiteboard
- various grants to cover some budget
- Driving a pickup truck (with ratchet straps)

## What could work better

- Need a BikeLink card ($20) or app ($5) for each student
- Keys: Label them (number/name/size) on day 1; leave in classroom
- Lanyards with student IDs / BikeLink cards
- Instructions for riding basics
- Park at Civic Center (not Embarc) BikeLink garage before GG Park
- Create a group chat (use WhatsApp?)
- More stretching
- Each teacher should have first aid kit
- Shorten some routes
- Tire Patch kits
- Have a recovery day after GGP (not Monday / Memorial Day off)

## What Problem Am I Solving?

As a teacher, I need classroom games to be **FAST** and **CHEAP**. When I searched for platform to play a Jeopardy review game with my students, I reviewed the options from Research.com: [10 Jeopardy Game Maker Tools for Teachers](https://research.com/software/guides/jeopardy-game-maker-tools#10) (February 2025), but found none that met my criteria.

This is my **top requirement**:

> I want to prepare a CSV file with questions, answers, categories, and point values. Then, I want to upload that CSV file to automatically generate a new game.

There are my **red flags**:

- ðŸš©&nbsp; Costs more than $5 per year.
- ðŸš©&nbsp; Setup takes more than 10 clicks (or 10 minutes).
- ðŸš©&nbsp; Difficult to upload or download my own data.
- ðŸš©&nbsp; Visual complexity or unfamiliar UI patterns.

While [Factile](https://www.playfactile.com/), [Jeopardy Labs](https://jeopardylabs.com/), and [SuperTeacherTools](https://www.superteachertools.us/jeopardyx/) are all usable, I thought I might make something easier to use.

<div class="title"> What's a CSV?</div>
A <strong>CSV</strong> file is like a spreadsheet, but simpler. It's a text-only file that stores data in rows and columns. Columns are separated by commas. Rows are separated by line breaks.

## What Did I Create?

With assistance from ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, it took me about 2 weeks to deploy a [playable version of the game](https://domlet.github.io/jeopardy-csv), as I envisioned it.

## Video Tutorial

Naturally, I created a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ntUGZEJkuoA). I fix bugs while I record these tutorials, so recording is the long twilight of the development process.

## What is "Challenge Week"?

Every Spring, 9th grade students at CCPA spend one week engaging a "challenge" curriculum. During this week, students follow a modified schedule that enables them to spend extended time working on group challenges. In 2023 and 2024, we focused on "Maker" themed challenges to address the hands-on maker education opportunities that students missed during distance learning due to the pandemic. During the week, students rotate between 1-day and 2-day challenges, and the week culminates in a pine wood derby competition.

## Trash Cars Challenge (3 hours)

From my experience coaching high school robotics, I know that kids love motors and are excited by electrified moving things. So, when I saw [this video of a simple DIY car with a tiny DC motor]({% link _posts/2024-04-22-maker-trash-cars-challenge.md %}#video-how-to-make-a-powered-car-very-simple---diy-electric) I knew that I could use this model to create an engaging, affordable, large-scale challenge for our 9th graders.

### Materials

_To serve 120 students working in pairs for 3 hours, we used..._

- Three [DC Motors kits (18 motors in each)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/18-Set-276PCS-DC-Motor-Kit-Mini-Electric-Circuit-Kit-DIY-Science-Projects-Motors-LED-Light-Vanes-Propeller-AA-Battery-Holder-Plastic-Gears-Electrical/5124711731) (read more below in 'what didn't work').
- AA and 9V batteries (the AA were useless, so I recommend ONLY 9V batteries)
- hot glue and glue guns
- lots of different sized rubber bands
- straws and fuse beads (crucial for wheel shafts)
- wire strippers (these are cheap but difficult to use)
- [wooden rounds](https://www.amazon.com/AxeSickle-Unfinished-Projects-Ornaments-Limitations/dp/B01DWK4884/ref=sr_1_19_sspa?crid=204AJMFFLKWWF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Oqe69wG_Un2JsU1khJxGrtBWuww4kGPrEUf5QXFgAJ7p0RfX65n8OfqFrGpEeRXicfMkJd7IDYfCFyvUhc60KMpOYhx3tzUOknYnCv6vl1VlUyJ_-M66izwlii4ZdJdICUyigRid4xPf8cS3Z5B7-kQdAerT0YBorpChw0dn1SRkdvKUH39SMbPGV36E4Ri03W1sooRDEwNiCZdhBTaakMO_u50OM1qI7Y-rYEh8tww4AW37htW40uLNOamJQlCd3A9a-r273rHN3j5pz7c0YV-ZqncqDgXLi_t1C3qvBQw.2lNtUy6peNx8nqD9bN8y35ydRkCWpcyW8rZyCfgwZuU&dib_tag=se&keywords=wooden%2Bcircles%2Bfor%2Bcrafts&qid=1734818634&sprefix=wooden%2Bcirc%2Caps%2C194&sr=8-19-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1) (I would use [wooden wheels](https://www.amazon.com/Wooden-Treaded-Perfect-Projects-GNIEMCKIN/dp/B0C5MKVYQL/ref=sr_1_14_sspa?crid=10XP3I2Y3SVUO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.W3IYVFCwAZS_Adje2YzL2bawaN78SSGXPDtfna4mQcaRf_6uwLwzdSFz89b0Y6MOhblR941mFGfsIZhrvb3wJLOy1mFObO_ociTcVWqcgyn_CXvKkv4KSuI4J4j9dpE8jl_BAvdq_Q1HAtQ8k816YitLIFPgz_5OZ_S51jggHtZeVAmSb4w44lBBt9wdnhpJUYtQCfUyebKu3fwX_l9idhzz3RISmhlCqg9jBo8iVDmszIWFull8UXlAha5_FEbAyW056rzHln5d0pbwjeuI58EzkKOyD3DaxUrsE-QdSus.P37XcjkSX8MRLrdmVNu5snIpmbhPq2MnTRWfIWshsMg&dib_tag=se&keywords=toy%2Bwheels&qid=1734818700&sprefix=toy%2Bwheels%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-14-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1) instead)
- assorted garbage (fruit baskets, cardboard, bottle caps...)
- straws, popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners
- power drills, drill press
- wire strippers, electrical tape

### Outcomes

_What worked well?_

- [paper workbook with scavenger hunt and QR codes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1csG47c-raoFEUnA-ecDjaA1V2DobzVfk1BjmaQ0t1dY/edit?tab=t.0)
- begin with scavenger hunt to welcome students into an unfamiliar classroom
- power outlets and glue guns were on the scavenger hunt (so students knew they were )
- one adult at drill station making sure students wear safety goggles
- leave same bit on the drill press (no swapping during worktime)
- students were very engaged

_What could work better?_

- cars needed to be SUPER LIGHT for these tiny motors
- the tension on rubber bands had to be JUST RIGHT for the motors
- getting the motor to power the car was VERY challenging (but students were very engaged with the problem and stayed remarkably motivated)
- wheels took too much time; provide better wheel materials so kids can focus on other issues
- some students had difficulty [stripping wires with these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LTHY9RD/ref=sspa_dk_detail_6?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B08LTHY9RD&pd_rd_w=EH4pR&content-id=amzn1.sym.f2f1cf8f-cab4-44dc-82ba-0ca811fb90cc&pf_rd_p=f2f1cf8f-cab4-44dc-82ba-0ca811fb90cc&pf_rd_r=W9DE796DAKA3CV3WCR2E&pd_rd_wg=jBXRy&pd_rd_r=b46d2c9b-f3ff-4760-83d2-4f6be8fc3816&s=hi&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM); could pre-strip or use better strippers

### Student Work

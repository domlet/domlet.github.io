## About CCPA

Coliseum College Preparatory Academy (CCPA) is a small public secondary school in Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) serving grades 6-12 on the Havenscourt campus in East Oakland. Our unique 7-year program offers stability and supports students to meet the requirements for college admission. Our graduates go to UCs, CSUs, and private universities.

CCPA invests in teachers and family relationships to meet learners' unique needs and support their development into thinkers, communicators, and powerful community members. We strive to value their passions and interests and connect their learning to the real world. We require students to demonstrate what they know and are able to do.

## Maintenance

For people and school map markers, you can edit the data in Google Sheets to modify the location of markers (longitude, latitude coordinates), and the information which appears on popups. You can edit which map markers appear (circles, icons, etc.) in the JavaScript code within `index.html`.

### Reminders

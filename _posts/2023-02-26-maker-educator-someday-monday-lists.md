## ‚ÄúMonday‚Äù list

Monday Lists are activities or projects that I have the materials to implement on short notice:

1. [Trash Cars Challenge]({% link _posts/2024-04-22-maker-trash-cars-challenge.md %}) (4 hours, 9th grade)
1. [Classroom IoT Garden with micro:bits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1dZvnDK8diLR5ri1aDfE1h_smqfcFox2VEQXFZTv0k/edit?tab=t.0) (Ongoing early finisher activity, 10th grade)
1. Bagged Challenge (marbles, pencils, string, dominos)

## ‚ÄúSomeday‚Äù list

Someday Lists are activities and projects in which I've outline the required materials AND the materials I still need to have donated, purchased, or made to outfit my makerspace. Someday lists are my next steps for my makerspace.

- [I use DonorsChoose]({% link _posts/2024-07-29-donorschoose.md%}#current-projects) to organize materials requests
- [I use Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTUT0ImVHR1ukonvOpyFbFwKoNblQzb99l9PQ-xtXe2-38w9NZSDg7zp8ctuMja_Lla-vzMx9urOpjV/pubhtml) to maintain materials wishlists
- [I use Google Tasks](https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?hl=en) to track specific To-Dos

## Google Tasks

I use Google Tasks to create to-do action items whenever they pop into my brain. It's ideal for one person, and it's convenient for me to switch between to-do lists for my work vs personal accounts. I would like to have an Alexa-to-Tasks skill...that's on my to-do list. ü§£
